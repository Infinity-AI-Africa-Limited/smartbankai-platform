# Requires the GitHub CLI, authenticated as someone with admin on the repository:
#   gh auth login
#
# Idempotent: re-running applies the same settings.
#
# The required checks below are the CI jobs that actually run on a pull request.
# A required check whose name does not match a real job, or which is skipped on
# pull_request, leaves every pull request waiting forever for a result that will
# never arrive. Verify with scripts/verify-branch-protection.mjs, which derives
# the expected set from the workflow instead of trusting this list.
